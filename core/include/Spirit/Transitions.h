A linear interpolation between two spin configurations on a chain.

The spins are moved along great circles connecting the start and end
points, making it the shortest possible connection path between the
two configurations.

- `idx_1`: the index of the first image
- `idx_2`: the index of the second image. `idx_2 > idx_1` is required

A helper function that makes the chain denser by inserting interpolated images between all images.

length of the chain

Adds some stochastic noise to the transition between two images.
